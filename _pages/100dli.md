After finishing with OSCP cert and trying to expand the scope of learning and knowledge, pentesting in web applications didn't sound like a bad idea knowing that people can legally do it among distint Bug Bounty platforms. The beginning of the journey seemed frustrating having many duplicates among different web vulnerabilities and programs. After looking on twitter some posts with the hashtag **"#100daystolearnandimprove"** starting with [Aishwarya Kendle](https://twitter.com/aish_kendle), the idea to start some kind of level up goal in 100 days seemed pretty interesting. 

Fortunately, I won't be walking through this path along due to my great collaborator [Rajesh Ranjan](https://twitter.com/eh_rajesh) had the idea to complete this goal as a manner of collaboration and open contribution. As young folks among the extensive infosec world, Rajesh and I will be sharing certain sources that have been helpful in our hunting journey. The soruces will vary from books, writeups, and amazing pentesters and hunters who share their talent in the infosec communities. Every post and day from 1 to 100 will be posted here. Every single feedback is welcome.
