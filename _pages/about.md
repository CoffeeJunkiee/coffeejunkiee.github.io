Welcome! my name is Samuel Paredes (CoffeeJunkie), I am a cybersecurity student origillary from Colombia and currently living in the US.

My main interest include penetration testing, malware analysis, OSINT, and programming. However, I always enjoy building and breaking all sorts of systems. I'm currently working towards my OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)certification and completing my major in cybersecurity.

In this site I write different walkthroughs from Hack The Box machines that are important to practice at the time of working towards my OSCP certification which helps to keep a constant practice and reminder to study and practice different concepts. Also, some content that helped me to pass through the OSCP exam (which I'm still trying to pass) will be posted in this site. 

If you have further questions do not hesitate to contact me.
