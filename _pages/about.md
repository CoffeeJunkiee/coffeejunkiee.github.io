Welcome! My name is Sam Paredes (CoffeeJunkie), I am a cybersecurity student origillary from Colombia and currently living in the US.

My main interests include penetration testing, malware analysis, OSINT, and programming. However, I always enjoy building and breaking all sorts of systems. I'm currently working towards my OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)    certification and completing my major in cybersecurity.

In this site I write different walkthroughs from Hack The Box machines that are good to practice at the time of working towards my OSCP certification which helps to keep a constant practice and learning different concepts.

If you have further questions do not hesitate to contact me.
