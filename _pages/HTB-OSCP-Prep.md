OSCP is one of the most wanted and demanded certification related to Offensive Security industry. The preparation, content, and exam contains a bast amount of time and information to study and comprehend, but still one of the basic knowledge learned during the cert due to the fast advance of offensive security. The mindset earned is priceless because it introduces you to the persistence, and mantra "Try Harder", which is something that drives people to the success and to overcome frustation during the OSCP journey. 

In this site, there are ten posts related to [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) and some machines that are similar to the OSCP lab. The posts published here had the purpose to practice, learn, and understand some of the basic methodology related to penetration testing, so if you're looking for some practice and preparation, you might find this useful. 

## Preparation and Final Goal

The preparation was to achieve 10 machines that were provided by [NetSec Focus](https://www.netsecfocus.com/) in order to obtain practice prior my third attempt to the OSCP exam. I have to say that before taking the OSCP I have had prior experience with several penetration testing and programming courses as also practice in platforms such as [Vuln Hub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) and [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/). After going through the OSCP learning material, and failing the OSCP exam twice, I decided to change my way of practice by learning and explaining machines from Hack The Box in this website. The final goal was achieved which was to pass the OSCP exam and earn the OSCP certification. 

### Write Ups OSCP Like

In the following content I will explain the ten machines that were published in this website in order to earn the OSCP certification. 

**Note:** All the machines showed here were write ups from retired machines from [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/)

Jeeves is an interesting and fun box to root due to the command script located in the web server and different ways to escalate privileges without the need of metasploit. If you're new with [Rotten or Juicy potato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato) this box might be a good place to start.
