Introduction from both sides

Before opening up with day 1, I'd like to give a big shout out to [Peter Yaworski](https://twitter.com/yaworsk) for his amazing contribution to the infosec community with his book [Real-World Bug Hunting](https://www.amazon.com/Real-World-Bug-Hunting-Field-Hacking-ebook/dp/B072SQZ2LG). The following days will describe some of vulnerabilites and attack scenearios explained in this book. 

## Open Redirect

Reading the book [Real-World Bug Hunting](https://www.amazon.com/Real-World-Bug-Hunting-Field-Hacking-ebook/dp/B072SQZ2LG) from [Peter Yaworski](https://twitter.com/yaworsk), in the first chapters of the book it explains how **open redirect can be combined with other attacks, and anable attackers to distribute malwarer from the malicious site or to steal OAuth tokens**. Open redirect attacks has certain importance and value depending on the place where the vulnerability is found. 
There are certain parameters that can lead to open redirects and can be found in the URLs. There are many names for these parameters, but some of them can be found as ```next, redirect, url, r, u, domain_name, return_to, and more```. In order to find these parameters, it is always good to look closely to the URLs. 

Some open redirect attacks can be found in the html code of the website with ```<meta>``` tags. The ```<meta>``` tags allow redirect actions from the browser. In order to trigger this vulnerability, there must be some kind of manipulation in the DOM, or attackers can  inject their own tag via some other vulnerability. In order to do this, the attacker can also sue JavaScript to manipiulate the ```window.location``` in the DOM. 

```
window.location = https://www.google.com/
window.location.href = https://www.google.com
window.location.replace(https://www.google.com)
```
## Ways to bypass open redirect protection

- If the website doesn't allow to insert a different domain in the URL, this can be one of the solutions.
```
accounts?return_to=////attacker.com
```
- If the website only allows site with the same source of domain, you can try the following.
```
checkout_url=.attacker.com”
checkout_url=.vicim.com.attacker.co”
```
