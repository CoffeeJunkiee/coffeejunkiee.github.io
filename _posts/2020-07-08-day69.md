Day 69 comes with a write up source on error base SQL and a good discover of SSRF on Zimbra by [Yasho](https://twitter.com/YShahinzadeh).

## Error base SQL

From [Rajesh Ranjan](https://twitter.com/eh_rajesh). Here is the link of the [article](https://medium.com/@hninja049/example-of-a-error-based-sql-injection-dce72530271c).


## SSRF on Zimbra

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). Trying to learn more about SSRF, I came across this write up from [Yasho](https://twitter.com/YShahinzadeh) which shows how SSRF occurred in Zimbra leading to steal credentials by doing a MITM attack. Somethin really interesting about the writeup was realted to the port scanning and different services that were running in the ports, also how memcached helped with this action. You can find the write up [here](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/story-of-a-2-5k-bounty-ssrf-on-zimbra-led-to-dump-all-credentials-in-clear-text-6fe826005ccc)
