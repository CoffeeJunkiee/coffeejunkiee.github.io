Day 49 comes with a writeup source for path traversal and a simple use for amass. 

## Path traversal and magic back slash

## Using amass as a hostile eye

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). This week I've been spending a decent amount of time using [amass] (https://github.com/OWASP/Amass) after wathing the Amass Bootcamp from Nahamsec. It was a little bit surprising new assets from a target that I really didn't discover before, it was very good at gathering information related at my target, but it took a long time to do it. In spite of the long wait, I have to say the the recon with amass was worth it. 

As any other tool, amass has its [user's guide](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass/blob/master/doc/user_guide.md) is well written and totally understandable. As the creator of amass said, we can spend a lot of hours talking about this tools, and doing couple bootcamps, but for today it will be some basics for subdomain enumeration, and IP resolving. 

### Subdomain enumeration

Amass can make a passive and active scan depending on the user. In my case I use both with this simple command. 
```
amass enum -brute -w dns.txt -d domain.com -o domain-subdomains.txt
```
Basically, what it will do it will gather subdomains in a passive phase first by looking more than 32 public resources in order to find subdomains. After doing the passive enumeration, it performs DNS brutefocing or subdomain bruteforce which will take a considerable amount of time depending on the DNS list and the targets. 

### IP gathering and resolving

Depending on the methodology og the hunter, IP resolving is important at the time to do port scanning using [masscan](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan). This command will gathered and resolved all the IPs by giving a list full of subdomains from the target. 

```
amass enum -ip -df subodmain-list.txt -o subdomain-ips.txt 
```

### Side note

Last weekend after having more free time as usual, I started to compare different subdomain enumeration tools where I got impressed with amass because it gave me better results without the need to use different tools at the same time. By reading the [user's guide](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass/blob/master/doc/user_guide.md) there are a lot of capabilities and further enumeration to do with the tool. So, if you're interested about using amass in your recon proceess, it's totally recomendable to use the [user's guide](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass/blob/master/doc/user_guide.md) for better results.
