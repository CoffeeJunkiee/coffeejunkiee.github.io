Day 65 comes with account takeover and favicon.ico for recon.

##  Account Takeover and Sensitive Data Leakage via CORS Misconfiguration

From [Rajesh Ranjan](https://twitter.com/eh_rajesh). Here is the link of the [article](https://lutfumertceylan.com.tr/posts/ato-and-data-leakage-via-cors-misc/).

## Favicon.ico and OSINT

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). While scrolling stuff on twitter, ```favicon.ico``` seemed to be a topic related to recon and different usages according its hash. It was curious to see what other people achieved to do with this and reminded me of [ShodanIsh](https://github.com/4z1zu/ShodanIsh) by 4z1zu. We talked about it back then in [day 14](https://coffeejunkie.me/day14/). So if you're curious take a look!
