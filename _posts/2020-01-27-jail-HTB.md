Jail is our fifth machine in the OSCP list provided by [NetSec Focus](https://www.netsecfocus.com/)! This machine was a great learning experience where buffer overflow, custom exploit development, and linux privilege escalation were crucial in order to obtain this machine. This machine show my weaknesses in buffer overflow, custom exploit development, and linux privilege escalation, so it was a great learning experience, and without [Booj's](https://reboare.github.io/htb/htb-jail.html) guide root this machine would've not been possible. This is the fifth blog before my third attempt to the OSCP exam, so let's get to it!

## Information Gathering

### Nmap Scan
So, we start with a nmap scan to check what ports are open and what services are running in this machine. 

```
nmap -sC -sV -p- -oN scan.nmap 10.10.10.34
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jail/nmap.png" alt="nmap scan">

So, we see some HTTP, RCPBIND, NFS, and a "random" service running. Actually, good results will come from the "random" service and the HTTP, about NFS we'll get that later. 

### Visiting Port 80 HTTP
The first thing we see getting in this port is a jail cell, which is relatable with the name of the machine.

Sounds like time to do some directory brute force!

### Directory Brute Force

Running [dirsearch](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch) in port 80 gave us a good result.
```
python3 dirsearch.py -u http://10.10.10.34 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -e php -t 50
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jail/dir-search.png" alt="nmap scan">

Yay! We got a good result with ```http://10.10.10.34/jailuser/``` let's check what's in there. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jail/jailuser.png" alt="nmap scan">

So, going to ```http://10.10.10.34/jailuser/dev``` there are three files that can give us useful information.

### Checking files from Jail

We start with ```jail.c``` and looking at the code it looks like buffer overflow!

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jail/bof-proof.png" alt="nmap scan">

According the screenshot showed above, there are variables that are "overflowable" because they can handle certain amount of characters before they overwrite the memory. Also the "random" service that we talked in our Nmap scan seems to be related with this buffer overflow because in the code shares its connection with port 7411.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jail/jail7411.png" alt="nmap scan">

Besides this in this code we can see some credentials that are going to be useful for exploit development. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jail/jail-userpass.png" alt="nmap scan">

Also, there is another file called ```compile.sh```, after giving it permissions it compiles the file and we can run it and start working with the debugger and some other things!

```
telnet localhost 7411
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jail/compile-proof.png" alt="nmap scan">

### Start Experimenting with buffer overflow and other things.

Time to run [gdb](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gdb-command-in-linux-with-examples/)! 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jail/gdb.png" alt="nmap scan">

After starting our debugger it's time to crearte a pattern, you can use gdb or the packet from metasploit for this which is located at /usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/
```
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l 50
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jail/pattern-create.png" alt="nmap scan">

Now that we have the pattern it's time to send it where we must overwrite the EIP which in this case is the password parameter.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jail/nc-bof.png" alt="nmap scan">

And we have found the memory address where EIP overwrites.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jail/gdb-found.png" alt="nmap scan">

That memory address will going to help us at the time to build the exploit. Now it't time to find thr pattern offsert which is going to tell how many characters we need to send in order to write instructions to be executed. 

```
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_offset.rb -q 62413961 -l 50
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jail/offset.png" alt="nmap scan">

The result means that we'll need 28 characters and after those characters we can execute instructions in memory. After having this it's time start building the exploit. To keep in mind, we are going to need a new address memory from the vicitm machin which in this case is jail due to the address showed above is from the localhost. This is the __memory address from Jail__.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jail/new-adress.png" alt="nmap scan">

Time to show the exploit!

### Exploit development & Obtaining Shell

In order to create the exploit we'll need the library [pwn](http://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/) and reusable [shellcode](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/34060) for linux. Other information needed is showed above such as memory address, amount of characters need it and commands to execute. If you want to download the exploit you can find it [here](https://github.com/Sayantan5/jail_exploit/blob/master/jail.py).

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jail/exploit-code.png" alt="nmap scan">

Once we make sure that the exploit is right and it's aimed to the correct target, time to execute it.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jail/nopriv-shell.png" alt="nmap scan">

We're in user nobody which means time for privilege escalation!

### Privilege Escalation

Do you remember the nfs service that was open in our nmap scan? let's check what's in there!

```
showmount -e 10.10.10.34
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jail/nfs.png" alt="nmap scan">

So, looks like there are some folder sharing ```/opt``` and ```/var/nfsshare/```. Time to mount them and see whar we can find. Before mounting them remember to create a folder in ```/tmp``` named  ```nfsshare```

```
mkdir /tmp/nfsshare
mount -t nfs 10.10.10.34:/var/nfsshare /tmp/nfsshare
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jail/mount-nfs.png" alt="nmap scan">
