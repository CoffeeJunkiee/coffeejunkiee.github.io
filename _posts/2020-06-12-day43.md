Day 43 comes with a resource for Self XSS to CSRF and Unrestricted File Uploads Capabilities!

## From Self XSS to CSRF

From [Rajesh Ranjan](https://twitter.com/eh_rajesh). Here is the link of the [article](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/how-i-leveraged-an-interesting-csrf-vulnerability-to-turn-self-xss-into-a-persistent-attack-b780824042d2).

## Unrestricted File Uploads Capabilities

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). One of my favorite vulnerabilities is [Unrestricted File Upload](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Unrestricted_File_Upload) due to all the countless capabilities that are possible to get from this vulnerability as long is doable. For this explanation, I'll keep it simple and on the go. 

### Couple Unrestricted File Upload Bypasses Part 1

1. **Always bruteforce extensions that are allowed**: Usually in some websites it says that certain files are allowed, but by using intruder from BurpSuite and a extensions [wordlist gathered from Seclists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Fuzzing), you might find more extensions available to upload. 

2. **Use nullbytes to truncate the file uploads**: Some websites allow ```jpg, png, gif, and pdf``` files at the time to upload the file, but it's possible to upload a ```php, html or other extension``` file by truncating the uploading function by using null bytes ```(%00)```. Therefore, it's possible to upload the file as ```shell.php%00.png```, and might be uploaded in the server as ```shell.php```. 

3. **Add small php bytes in pictures**: Is the server analyzing and validating the files? if not, you might want to use small php bytes in ```jpg``` pictures. In that case I strongly recommend the following tool called [php-jpeg-injector](https://github.com/dlegs/php-jpeg-injector), and the following file upload bypass [writeup](https://secgeek.net/bookfresh-vulnerability/).

4. **RCE might not be possible but SSRF could be**: Sometimes RCE cannot be achieved, neither stored XSS, but how about SSRF from uploading files? Well, if there is the parameter ```type="file"``` change it to ```type="url"``` and submit a URL.

There are COUNTLESS ways to bypass and extend this attack which I'd love to talk in the following days, but by know, the 4 bypasses and capabilities from above are just for today :)
