## Checking for endpoints in drupal?

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). Trying to find more endpoints in couple drupal targets, I found a tweet from [Adrien](https://twitter.com/adrien_jeanneau) which helped me out to find more endpoints to test in a Drupal CMS application.
