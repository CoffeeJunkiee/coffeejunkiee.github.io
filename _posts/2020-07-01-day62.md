Day 62 comes with some basic understanding about Javascript in web apps 

# From a noob for noobs on what to do with Javascript in web apps

Learning lately to read certain Javascript files in order to understand security flaws,  I found myself asking many questions about the topic and basically why it is implemented in web applications. From a noob myself, this is aimed to noob audience who might be interested in the topic. All the information has been gathered from this [article](https://medium.com/@patelkathan22/beginners-guide-on-how-you-can-use-javascript-in-bugbounty-492f6eb1f9ea).

## Simplified Explanation on Why Javascript is used

Javascript is used in the client-side and the server-side which allows you to **make web pages interactive**. Saying that, we can say that Javascript is helping to the users to have a better engaging, dynamic, and interactive experience.


## Using Javascript at the time to hunt 

We are going to be touching here certain things to do which allows a better gathering and understading of the target according its JS files. 

### 1. Get JSfiles links from a target 

This step can be totally automated by some bash scripting, there are plenty of tools out there which will help to gather the information need it. 

The tools are: 
- [subjs](https://github.com/lc/subjs)
- [getJS](https://github.com/003random/getJS)
- [gau](https://github.com/lc/gau)

### 2. Finding endpoints in JS files

Alos, ther are several tools which can gather endpoints from JS files. In order to do this you can use [linkfinder](https://github.com/GerbenJavado/LinkFinder).

One of the reasons why some hunters collect endpoints gathered from JS files is due to there might be endpoints that might not be available in a simple view. 

## 3. Find secrets with SecretFinder

In some cases, different kind of API keys might be stored in JS files, that's why [secretfinder](https://github.com/m4ll0k/SecretFinder) comes useful at this time.
