Day 56 comes with a write up source related to Misconfigured CORS via Wildcard Subdomains and handy google dorks page.

## Misconfigured CORS via Wildcard Subdomains

From [Rajesh Ranjan](https://twitter.com/eh_rajesh). Here is the link of the [article](https://www.geekboy.ninja/blog/exploiting-misconfigured-cors-via-wildcard-subdomains/).

## Handy Google Dorks page

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_).Having the time to search for more sources which might improve the way on how recon can go, I came across this site which makes google dorks semi-automatic. I say semi-automatic because it puts the dorks on google for you, and it gives you the freedom to look for it manually. Check [this site out](https://pentest-tools.com/information-gathering/google-hacking).
