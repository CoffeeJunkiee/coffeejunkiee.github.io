Day 38 comes with some rest after a week with couple reports. Tomorrow monday we'll see how they got solved, they still in triaged ! Besides that a write up about GraphQL and some Bill Hicks.

## Stealing Addresses through GraphQL

From [Rajesh Ranjan](https://twitter.com/eh_rajesh) and [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). GraphQL sounds pretty interesting in diverse ways. In this case the attacker was able to steal addresses through the API with the following URL query.
```
https://api.stg.target.com/graphq?query={__schema{types{name,fields{name}}}} (And yes it throws all the typenames and field values}
```
