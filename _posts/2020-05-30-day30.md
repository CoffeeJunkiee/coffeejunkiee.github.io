Day 30 comes with two resources related to weak cryptography to open redirect and RCE examples for beginners!

## Weak Cryptography to Open redirect

From [Rajesh Ranjan](https://twitter.com/eh_rajesh). Yesterday, I shared a writeup about weak cryptography to account takeover. Today I came with another writeup in which there was a weak cryptography, in which ```redirect=``` parameter was vulnerable to open redirect. Do check out this writeup [here](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/weak-cryptography-leads-to-open-redirect-3fe052c12995)

## RCE examples for beginners

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). For some reason, RCE looks facinating to me due to its various capabilities that are related to privilege escalation and vulnerability chain. As a small contribution, here it is a writeup that explain simple cases of RCE in a pretty well writen article. You can find it [here](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/simple-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-examples-for-beginners-985867878311)
