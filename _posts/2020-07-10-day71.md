## URL Tracking 

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). As a noobie, many ideas come to my mind wondering how the workflow at the time to hunt can be improved. Fortunately there is a supportive community and amazing tools that people make which makes everything more doable. In this case [url-tracker](https://github.com/ahussam/url-tracker) help us out to do monitoring and check changes that has been happenning with websites that we're testing. What [url-tracker](https://github.com/ahussam/url-tracker) does is it check the content of the web application in different periods of time wheret is hourly, daily, weekly, monthly. Big shoutouts to [Abdullah Hussam](https://twitter.com/Abdulahhusam) for his work.
