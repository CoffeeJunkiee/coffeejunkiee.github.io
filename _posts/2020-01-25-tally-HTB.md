Tally is our third machine in the OSCP list provided by [NetSec Focus](https://www.netsecfocus.com/)! This machine was a great learning experience where the solution problem and research skills were essential in order to root this machine. This is the third blog before my third attempt to the OSCP exam, so let's get to it!

## Information Gathering

### Nmap Scan
So, we start with a nmap scan to check what ports are open and what services are running in this machine. 

```
nmap -sC -sV -p- -oN scan.nmap 10.10.10.59
```
