Before starting with couple ways to complete this box, there is an update in the OSCP list due to this is the second box in the list before taking my third attempt to the OSCP exam! As I said before, I chose this list from  [NetSec Focus](https://www.netsecfocus.com/) in order to improve my penetration testing skills. From this list Bart is the second box, so letâ€™s get to it.

## Information Gathering

### Nmap Scan
As always starting with a nmap scan to check what ports are open and what services are running in this machine.

Looks like we have a HTTP service running in port 80 and according nmap it redirects to ```http://forum.bart.htb``` which means that we might want to add this in the ```/etc/hosts``` list.
