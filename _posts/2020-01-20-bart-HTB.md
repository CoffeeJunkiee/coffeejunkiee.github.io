Before starting with couple ways to complete this box, there is an update in the OSCP list due to this is the second box in the list before taking my third attempt to the OSCP exam! As I said before, I chose this list from  [NetSec Focus](https://www.netsecfocus.com/) in order to improve my penetration testing skills. From this list Bart is the second box, so letâ€™s get to it.

## Information Gathering
### Nmap Scan
As always, starting with a nmap scan to check what ports are open and what services are running in this machine. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/nmap-scan.png" alt="nmap-scan">

Looks like we have a HTTP service running in port 80 and according nmap it redirects to ```http://forum.bart.htb``` which means that we might want to add this in the ```/etc/hosts``` list. To do this just type in the terminal:
```
nano /etc/hosts
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/etc-hosts.png" alt="etc-hosts">

Once ```forum.bart.htb``` and ```bart.htb``` are added, browsing the website we finally find some results.

## Directory Brute Force
Then having HTTP service running in port 80 and have added the hosts in the ```/etc/hosts``` list, it's time to use [dirsearch](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch) in order to get some results from ```http://forum.bart.htb```, but unfortunately, the results are not helpful. 

```
python3 dirsearch.py -u http://forum.bart.htb -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -e php -t 50
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/dir-no-find.png" alt="dir-no-find">

Then, thinking around to get something else, a scan in ```http://bart.htb``` didn't sound like a bad idea, so this time we got some results.

```
python3 dirsearch.py -u http://bart.htb -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -e php -t 50
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/dir-bart-good.png" alt="dir-bart-good">

So, navigating to ```http://bart.htb/monitor/``` we have some log in form with the __"Forgot password?"__ option, that means that we can try some name of the employees that appear in the website. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/monitor-login.png" alt="monitor-login">

These are the employees that the website shows. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/team.png" alt="team">

So, after finding out the log in form and the name of a couple employees it doesn't sound a bad idea to do some brute force to get the password, but the names that we normally find in the website don't work besides Daniel, but unfortunately his name won't get us far. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/forgot-pass-error.png" alt="forgot-pass">

So, what comes later to check more usernames to make some brute force, we go to the page source, and effectively we found some commented code from __Harvey__ who is the developer.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/lazy-harvey.png" alt="lazy-harvey">

And Harvey is the username that is going to get us far with this machine.

## Password Brute Force
Before doing brute forcing at ```http://bart.htb/monitor```, we need two essential things. 
1. A sharp word-list with sharp data in order to brute force the password.
2. A sharp tool in order to make the bruteforcing where in this case I used [BurpSuite](https://portswigger.net/burp) and [hydra](https://tools.kali.org/password-attacks/hydra).

### 1. Making a sharp word-list
After following a couple guides of how to get this box, I was not very convinced with the way of how to get the wordlist from the website because the password didn't show up after following the steps. So the usage of cewl was crucial, but also the page source code was the key in order to find the password. 

## My solution
I downloaded the whole index page of the website in order to get out the commented code and make it show up in my own web server using python. Using this, at the time to use cewl, the password would show up there making some modifications. 

First I downloaded the index page with [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html). 
```
curl http://forum.bart.htb/ > bart.html
```

After have downloaded the code, I set up a web server with python in the location where I had the index of the website in order to see the data. 

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
```
And then, the file was there

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/local-bart.png" alt="local-bart">

Once we see the file in the server, it's the time to modify it deleting some of the commented code in order to make seeable some of the information from Harvery Potter. So, we delete as the picture below shows. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/local-bart-delete.png" alt="local-bart-delete">

After deleting the comentede code, it should look something like this. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/local-bart-delete-after.png" alt="local-bart-delete-after">

Then, now if we open the file from our localhost in the browser it should appear this information down below where it says "our team".

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/show-harvey.png" alt="show-harvey">

Now, it's time to make our wordlist using the toold [cewl](https://tools.kali.org/password-attacks/cewl).

```
cewl --email http://localhost/bart.html> list.txt
```

Where:

```--email``` Allows to extract some of the visible emails in the index page given.

Then after executing the command above, at the end of the list should appear the following emails. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/before-sharp.png" alt="before-sharp">

At the time to do some brute forcing, it sound like a bad idea to do it with email lists, so I modified the list to look sharper just with the last names of the employees. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/after-sharp.png" alt="after-sharp">

Now, we have a sharp wordlist for our brute force attack!

## 2. Sharp tools to do brute force (BurpSuite & Hydra)
To do the brute forcing once having a sharp wordlist, I was trying to learn how to do bruteforcing with Burpsuite and Hydra where both gave great results. Here I'll explain the usage of these two.

### Burpsuite
To use burpsuite we are going to need to configure a proxy to pass the traffic through BurpSuite, to do this I used [Foxy Proxy](https://help.getfoxyproxy.org/index.php/knowledge-base/how-to-use-your-proxy-service-with-firefox-and-foxyproxy-extension/) because is quite easy to set the proxy up. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/foxy-proxy.png" alt="foxy-proxy">

Once the proxy is configured with our browser, it's time to make the HTTP request adding a value to the password while intercepting the HTTP request, so we can see how it looks once the request is in BurpSuite. Once the request is in burpsuite, we are going to use __"intruder"__ in order to do the brute force attack.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/before-intruder.png" alt="before-intruder">

We clear the values that we are not going to brute force as is shown in the picture down below. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/clear-intruder.png" alt="clear-intruder">

After clearing the values that we are not going to use, it's time to stablish the list that we got from the index page (The list showed above).

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/after-intruder.png" alt="after-intruder">

Now that everything has been set it's time to "Start Attack" as the picture shows above and wait until the password is being cracked. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/password-cracked.png" alt="password-cracked">

So, after starting the attack and waiting a couple minutes, looking at the lenght of the requests looks like ```"potter"``` is the password, so password cracked! which means ```user: havery, password: potter```. After the password was cracked, our browser doesnt recognized ```http://monitor.bart.htb```. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/monitor-not-found.png" alt="monitor-not-found">

Which means that we have to add this to our ```/etc/hosts``` list. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/etc-monitor.png" alt="etc-monitor">

and wolah! we're officially in.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/in-monitor.png" alt="in-monitor">

After looking around in ```"Servers"``` looks like we have something else to look at ```http://internal-01.bart.htb```. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/before-internal.png" alt="before-internal">

Which means that we should add ```http://internal-01.bart.htb``` in our ```/etc/hosts``` as well. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/etc-internal.png" alt="etc-internal">

and wolah! we can see internal now. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/after-internal.png" alt="after-internal">

Then we need to crack another password, but this time we'll use hydra!

### Hydra
