Before starting with couple ways to complete this box, there is an update in the OSCP list due to this is the second box in the list before taking my third attempt to the OSCP exam! As I said before, I chose this list from  [NetSec Focus](https://www.netsecfocus.com/) in order to improve my penetration testing skills. From this list Bart is the second box, so letâ€™s get to it.

## Information Gathering
### Nmap Scan
As always, starting with a nmap scan to check what ports are open and what services are running in this machine.

Looks like we have a HTTP service running in port 80 and according nmap it redirects to ```http://forum.bart.htb``` which means that we might want to add this in the ```/etc/hosts``` list. To do this just type in the terminal:
```
nano /etc/hosts
```

Once ```forum.bart.htb``` and ```bart.htb``` are added, browsing the website we finally find some results.

## Directory Brute Force
Then having HTTP service running in port 80 and have added the hosts in the ```/etc/hosts``` list, it's time to use [dirsearch](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch) in order to get some results from ```http://forum.bart.htb```, but unfortunately, the results are not helpful. 

```
python3 dirsearch.py -u http://forum.bart.htb -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -e php -t 50
```

Then, thinking around to get something else, a scan in ```http://bart.htb``` didn't sound like a bad idea, so this time we got some results.

```
python3 dirsearch.py -u http://bart.htb -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -e php -t 50
```

So, navigating to ```http://bart.htb/monitor/``` we have some log in form with the __"Forgot password?"__ option, that means that we can try some name of the employees that appear in the website.

These are the employees that the website shows.
