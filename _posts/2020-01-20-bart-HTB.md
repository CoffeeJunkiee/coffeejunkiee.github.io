Before starting with couple ways to complete this box, there is an update in the OSCP list due to this is the second box in the list before taking my third attempt to the OSCP exam! As I said before, I chose this list from  [NetSec Focus](https://www.netsecfocus.com/) in order to improve my penetration testing skills. From this list Bart is the second box, so letâ€™s get to it.

## Information Gathering
### Nmap Scan
As always, starting with a nmap scan to check what ports are open and what services are running in this machine. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/nmap-scan.png" alt="nmap-scan">

Looks like we have a HTTP service running in port 80 and according nmap it redirects to ```http://forum.bart.htb``` which means that we might want to add this in the ```/etc/hosts``` list. To do this just type in the terminal:
```
nano /etc/hosts
```

Once ```forum.bart.htb``` and ```bart.htb``` are added, browsing the website we finally find some results.

## Directory Brute Force
Then having HTTP service running in port 80 and have added the hosts in the ```/etc/hosts``` list, it's time to use [dirsearch](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch) in order to get some results from ```http://forum.bart.htb```, but unfortunately, the results are not helpful. 

```
python3 dirsearch.py -u http://forum.bart.htb -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -e php -t 50
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/dir-no-find.png" alt="dir-no-find">

Then, thinking around to get something else, a scan in ```http://bart.htb``` didn't sound like a bad idea, so this time we got some results.

```
python3 dirsearch.py -u http://bart.htb -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -e php -t 50
```

So, navigating to ```http://bart.htb/monitor/``` we have some log in form with the __"Forgot password?"__ option, that means that we can try some name of the employees that appear in the website. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/monitor-login.png" alt="monitor-login">

These are the employees that the website shows. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/team.png" alt="team">

So, after finding out the log in form and the name of a couple employees it doesn't sound a bad idea to do some brute force to get the password, but the names that we normally find in the website don't work besides Daniel, but unfortunately his name won't get us far.

So, what comes later to check more usernames to make some brute force, we go to the page source, and effectively we found some commented code from __Harvey__ who is the developer.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bart/lazy-harvey.png" alt="lazy-harvey">

And Harvey is the username that is going to get us far with this machine.

## Password Brute Force
Before doing brute forcing at ```http://bart.htb/monitor```, we need two essential things. 
1. A sharp word-list with sharp data in order to brute force the password.
2. A sharp tool in order to make the bruteforcing where in this case I used [BurpSuite](https://portswigger.net/burp).

### 1. Making a sharp word-list
After following a couple guides of how to get this box, I was not very convinced with the way of how to get the wordlist from the website because the password didn't show up after following the steps. So the usage of cewl was crucial, but also the page source code was the key in order to find the password. 

#### My solution
I downloaded the whole index page of the website in order to get out the commented code and make it show up in my own web server using python. Using this, at the time to use cewl, the password would show up there making some modifications. 

First I downloaded the index page with [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html). 
```
curl http://forum.bart.htb/ > bart.html
```

After have downloaded the code, I set up a web server with python in the location where I had the index of the website in order to see the data. 

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
```
And then, the file was there
