From [Rajesh Ranjan](https://twitter.com/eh_rajesh).  In this writeup, Youâ€™ll see how a researcher was able to bypass the CSRF protection by changing the request method from POST to GET which ended up with Account takeover vulnerability. Check out the writeup [here](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/lets-bypass-csrf-protection-password-confirmation-to-takeover-victim-accounts-d-4a21297847ff).

## HTTP Smuggling 

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). While looking for more things to learn and more vulnerabilities to check, HTTP Smuggling seemed as something pretty interesting to learn lately, so I checked couple labs and writeups in order to learn HTTP Smuggling, I'll be updating the learning path for this vulnerability later on. 

### Learning Sources

- [PortSwigger Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling): Has some hands on practice realted to this kind of vulnerabilities. 

- Write Ups and Explanations: As I have said before, some of the best sources at my opinion to learn other vulnerabilities are writeups from other hackers. Therefore here they are:
    - [Stored XSS on https://paypal.com/signin via cache poisoning](https://portswigger.net/research/http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn)
    - [HTTP Request Smuggling on vpn.lob.com](https://hackerone.com/reports/694604)
    - [HTTP SMUGGLING EXPOSED HMAC/DOS](https://hackerone.com/reports/753939)
