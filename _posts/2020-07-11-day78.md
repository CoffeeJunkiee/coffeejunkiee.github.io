Day 78 comes with a write up source related to admin disclosure and roadmaps for hunting learning :)

## Page Admin Disclosure on Facebook

From [Rajesh Ranjan](https://twitter.com/eh_rajesh). Here is the link for the [article](https://medium.com/@sudipshah_66336/the-story-of-my-first-4-digit-bounty-from-facebook-3a29830e03cd).

## Roadmaps

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). Looking for more information, stills impressing how twitter can be pretty useful at the time to look for different kind of roadmaps. There is enough information to learn and apply in the journey, but i'd agree that's good to share and read the effor collected from the people. This time [Shiv chouhan](https://twitter.com/1ndianl33t) gave us pretty good sources to get us started to go with us in the path :) 
You can find the roadmap [here](https://github.com/1ndianl33t/Bug-Bounty-Roadmaps).

That's it for today, happy Friday.
