Hawk is our eighth machine in the OSCP list provided by [NetSec Focus](https://www.netsecfocus.com/)! Flaws with FTP, file coded in base64, services running, tunneling, and a new way to do some privilege escalation are part of this machine with hawk! The learning acquired from here shows some common flaws and misconfigurations. This is the eighth blog before my third attempt to the OSCP exam, so let's get to it!

## Information Gathering


### Nmap Scan
So, we start with a nmap scan to check what ports are open and what services are running in this machine.
```
nmap -sC -sV -p- -oN scan.nmap 10.10.10.91
```
