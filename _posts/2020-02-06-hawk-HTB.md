Hawk is our eighth machine in the OSCP list provided by [NetSec Focus](https://www.netsecfocus.com/)! Flaws with FTP, file coded in base64, services running, tunneling, and a new way to do some privilege escalation are part of this machine with hawk! The learning acquired from here shows some common flaws and misconfigurations. This is the eighth blog before my third attempt to the OSCP exam, so let's get to it!

## Information Gathering


### Nmap Scan
So, we start with a nmap scan to check what ports are open and what services are running in this machine.
```
nmap -sC -sV -p- -oN scan.nmap 10.10.10.102
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hawk/nmap.png" alt="nmap scan">

There are couple ports and services running such as FTP in port 21 (which we can log in an anonymous), SSH in port 22, HTTP in port 80, and H2 Database in port 8082. There are other ports that are not named in this article.

### Loging FTP as Anonymous
So as I said before, we can login in FTP as anonymous user, and actually, going to the directory ```messages``` there is a file that might contain interesting information which is  ```.drupal.txt.enc```

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hawk/ftp.png" alt="nmap scan">

aftergetting the file, we see that has a password and it is base64 encoded, so let's decode it. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hawk/ftp-gotten.png" alt="nmap scan">

So, to decode we use the command with [base64](https://linux.die.net/man/1/base64) to get the file.
```
base64 -d drupal.txt.enc > drupal_decode.txt.enc
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hawk/decode.png" alt="nmap scan">

Great! Now it's time to crack the password!

### Brute Forcing SSL Salted Password

As we saw the format displayed with the images above, there is a program that can help us to crack this SSL salted password called [bruteforce-salted-openssl](https://github.com/glv2/bruteforce-salted-openssl), and we are using the wordlist rockyou.
