Day 91 comes with some readings on Sam Curry's find in starbucks. 

## Into Starbucks Database

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). Reading [this post](https://samcurry.net/hacking-starbucks/) from [Sam Curry](https://twitter.com/samwcyo), It came pretty handy to see how path traversal vulnerabilities can come pretty handy these times. He found a call in the starbucks API which can retrieve the information of nearly 100 million users with the following path traversal attack. 

```
GET /bff/proxy/stream/v1/users/me/streamItems/web\..\.\..\.\..\.\..\.\..\.\..\.\search\v1\Accounts\ HTTP/1.1
Host: app.starbucks.com
```
Where the path ```\search\v1\Accounts\``` retrieve the information of the nearly 100 million users.
