Jail is our fifth machine in the OSCP list provided by [NetSec Focus](https://www.netsecfocus.com/)! This machine was a great learning experience where SMB enumeration and some knowledge about [kerberos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol))  were essential in order to root this machine. This is the fifth blog before my third attempt to the OSCP exam, so let's get to it!
