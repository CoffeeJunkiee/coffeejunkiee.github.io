Day 59 comes with simple bash scripting for noobies :)

# Bash Scripting that saves time

Have you ever found yourself typing the same commands over and over thinking that the job can be more easier? Well, if you're in a unix environment, it is pretty easy and possible to make the job way easier! **You don't need to be a master in programming, making simple bash scripts is not complicated**. This is aimed to noobie audience who might be afraid of making simple scripts in order to make their workflow more unique and faster. 

Bash scripting basically is typing the commands that you constantly use, and changing some words so the computer understands the input, and takes care of the output. In this case I'll explain the "code" in a simple way so you can do it yourself and add more things. If you're making your own scripts, I strongly recommend to move them to the ```/usr/local/bin``` folder. 

## Directory searching with ffuf (simple bash script)

To avoid typing the same command in ffuf over and over, you can start making a simple bash script as:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

ffuf -c -w wordlist.txt -u $1/FUZZ/ -mc 200,301,302

```
**To explain**: 

- ```#!/bin/bash``` makes the computer understand that you're executing a bash script. 
- ```$1``` makes the computer understand that it is going to take the first input to fuzz.
- Remember to save the file with a ```.sh``` extension and give executable permissions. 

**Running the script**

In this case, you just have to run the script as:
```
./fuzzer.sh https://yahoo.com
```

## Subdomain enumeration with amass by just getting a wordlist 

I usually like to make enumerate subdomains all of them at the time by putting the in a list and running an script with the following code. 

```bash
#!/bin/bash

filename=$1

while read line; do 
	amass enum -d $line -o $filename-amass.txt
done < $filename
```

**To explain**: 

-  ```while``` is a simple loop that will work until something is false. 
- ```filename``` variable will take the first part of the input. 
- ```while read line; do``` basically we're telling while you read the line please do the scan by each line. 

**Running the script**

In this case, you just have to run the script as:
```
./subenum.sh domains.txt
```
