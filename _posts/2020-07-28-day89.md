## HTTP Smuggling Must Reads

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). Learning lately a little bit more about HTTP Desync Attacks, it seems so interesting all the capabilities that these attacks can provide in a great base. From account take overs, web cache poisoning, DOM and reflected XSS, to other kind of information disclosure. This topic can be a little confused, that's why [albinowax's](https://twitter.com/albinowax) research  has come handy at this time. In order to have a better understanding of these kind of attacks, I strongly suggest to reading the following resources. 

1. [HTTP Desync Attacks: Request Smuggling Reborn](https://portswigger.net/research/http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn)
2. [HTTP Desync Attacks: what happened next](https://portswigger.net/research/http-desync-attacks-what-happened-next)

That's it for today, happy taco Tuesday.
