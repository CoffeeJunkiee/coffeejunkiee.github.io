Day 42 comes with SAML Testing and Deserialization vulnerabilities and practice. 

## SAML Testing

## Deserialization Vulnerabilities and Exercises

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). Deserialization vulnerabilities are pretty interesting due to their capabilities to the point where it can achieve RCE (Remote Code Execution). There are several articles and reports that we have shared before in other days, but this time I'm gonna share where you can actually put hands on practice. 

- [Pentesterlab](https://pentesterlab.com/badges/jserialize): Pentesterlab has some pretty good exercises which are simple and pretty interesting to do. 

- [ZeroNights-WebVillage-2017](https://github.com/GrrrDog/ZeroNights-WebVillage-2017): Which has been gathered from [this tweet](https://twitter.com/antyurin/status/932720590284312576), it offers hand on practice with different programming languages. 

Sounds like a weekend plan for whoever is interested in this vulnerabilities!
