Day 84 comes with some readings on DOM XSS due to the usage of paraminer.

## From param miner to DOM XSS

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). Lately spending some times in [PortSwigger Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security), came to realization (for a newbie) that paraminer ended up being pretty useful, not only to guess parameters in different endpoints, also to guess body parameters, headers, and cookies! This case, in this write up there is a the usefulness from paraminer which gave to the attacker a pretty nice DOM XSS. You can check teh write up [here](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/the-1-000-worth-cookie-6cf48af08e08).
