## Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)

From [Rajesh Ranjan](https://twitter.com/eh_rajesh). Security Assertion Markup Language, or SAML, is a standardized way to tell external applications and services that a user is who they say they are. SAML makes single sign-on (SSO) technology possible by providing a way to authenticate a user once and then communicate that authentication to multiple applications. The most current version of SAML is SAML 2.0
What is single sign-on (SSO)?
Single sign-on (SSO) is a way for users to be authenticated for multiple applications and services at once. With SSO, a user signs in at a single login screen and can then use a number of apps. Users do not need to confirm their identity with every single service they use
The implementation of SSO is easy if multiple services are located under the same parent domain. Like these two versions of Facebook

```
www.facebook.com
m.facebook.com
```

These two services are located on the same domain, facebook.com. In this case, SSO can be easily achieved by sharing cookies across subdomains

```
Set-Cookie: cookie=abc123; Domain=facebook.com; Secure; HttpOnly
```

However, cookies cannot be shared across different domains. So Facebook.com and Messenger.com cannot share cookies, because they donâ€™t share a common parent domain
And this is where SAML comes into play.


## How does SAML work?

A typical SSO authentication process involves these three parties:
-	Principal (also known as the "subject")
-	Identity provider
-	Service provider

**Principal/subject:** This is almost always a human user who is trying to access a cloud-hosted application.


**Identity provider:** An identity provider (IdP) is a cloud software service that stores and confirms user identity, typically through a login process. Essentially, an IdP's role is to say, "I know this person, and here is what they are allowed to do.


**Service provider:** This is the cloud-hosted application or service the user wants to use. Common examples include cloud email platforms such as Gmail and Microsoft Office 365, cloud storage services such as Google Drive and AWS S3, and communications apps such as Slack and Skype.


A Basic workflow of SAML is represented below

## XXE in POST Request Allowing XML and JSON in their Responses

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). Couple week ago while doing couple exercises from [PentesterLab](https://pentesterlab.com/), there was something interesting that seemed amazingly similar to [this](https://twitter.com/11xuxx/status/1250764273623629826) tweet from [Ashkan Jahanbakhsh](https://twitter.com/11xuxx).
