Day 92 comes with some readings on CWFF to make custom wordlists. 

## CWFF to Make Custom Wordlists

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). [Karim Shoair](https://twitter.com/D4Vinci1) recently released his tool that would make the job of making custom wordlists for different targets much easier at first glance. I gave it a short yesterday with pretty good results on some of the desired endpoints where I wanted to test. You can find the following options with the tool. 

```
CWFF [-h] [--threads] [--github] [--subdomains] [--recursive] [--js-libraries] [--connected-websites] [--juicy-files] [--use-filter-model] [-o] domain

positional arguments:
  domain                Target website(ofc)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit
  --threads             The number of maximum concurrent threads to use (Default:1000)
  --github              Collect endpoints from a given github repo (ex:https://github.com/google/flax)
  --subdomains          Extract endpoints from subdomains also while search in the wayback machine!
  --recursive           Work on extracted endpoints recursively (Adds more endpoints but less accurate sometimes)!
  --js-libraries        Extract endpoints from JS libraries also, not just the JS written by them!
  --connected-websites  Include endpoints extracted from connected websites
  --juicy-files         Include endpoints extracted from juicy files like sitemap.xml and robots.txt
  --use-filter-model    Filter result endpoints with filter_model file
  -o                    The output directory for the endpoints and parameters. (Default: website name)
```
