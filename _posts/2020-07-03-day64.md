Day 64 comes with recon in samsung repositories and harpoon for osint!

## Harpoon Osint 

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). Trying to expand a little bit more the information gathered during recon, I came across this tool that was recommended by [0xPatrick](https://0xpatrik.com/) which looked very helpful in the beggining.
