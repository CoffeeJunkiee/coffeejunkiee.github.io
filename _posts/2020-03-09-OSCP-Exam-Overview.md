After going through the ten "hard bug good practice" machines recommended by [NetSec Focus](https://www.netsecfocus.com/), I decided to put countless hours behind the screen and practice things such as information gathering (professional googling), exploitation, privilege escalation, and documentation. The practice, successes, failures, and persistence gave good results due to I was able to earn my OSCP certification after failing the exam twice. This post will be related to things to look for if you decide to go for the exam, and giving a brief overview about the experience. This is the list provided by [NetSec Focus](https://www.netsecfocus.com/).
