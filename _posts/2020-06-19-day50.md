Day 50 comes with a writeup source about vertical privilege escalation and finding endpoints. 

## Small Investment to Simple Vertical Privilege Escalation

From [Rajesh Ranjan](https://twitter.com/eh_rajesh). Here is the [writeup](https://medium.com/@aniltom/magic-of-the-back-slash-d868e66b532a). 

## Need to find some endpoints?

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). Being invited to a private program with a large scope, I came across with the question "where the hell should I start?" well, by enumerating the subdomains I went with the target on scope that has a lot of subdomains to check. Ok, what's next then? talking to [Rajesh Ranjan](https://twitter.com/eh_rajesh) and explaining him that I was getting a little bit tired of enumerating and attacking sites finding no bugs and without bypassing the content filters in the site he sent me a pretty good resource related to [gf](https://github.com/tomnomnom/gf) which is a tool created by tomnomnom.  [gf](https://github.com/tomnomnom/gf) will help us out to grep the endpoints in order to find possible XSS, SSRF, Open redirects and more.

### Time to find the endpoints

You can run the following bash script in order to find the endpoints. You will need [waybackurls](https://github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls), [gau](https://github.com/lc/gau), and [paramspider](https://github.com/devanshbatham/ParamSpider).

```bash
#!/bin/bash

## Gather all the endpoints
echo "$1" | waybackurls > $1-wayback.txt
echo "$1" | gau > $1-gau.txt
python3 paramspider.py --domain $1 --output $1-param.txt

## Merge the lists :)

sort $1-wayback.txt $1-gau.txt output/$1-param.txt | uniq > $1-endpoints.txt

## Clean up a bit 

rm -rf $1-wayback.txt $1-gau.txt output/$1-param.txt

```

Great! Once you got all the endpoints we can use the [gf_profiles](https://github.com/devanshbatham/ParamSpider/tree/master/gf_profiles) found in paramspider in order to gather the endpoints. For more information on how to use the gf_profiles read paramspider and gf documentation. 

```
gf xss domain.com-endpoints.txt
gf potential domain.com-endpoints.txt
```

After running the commands there will be some results related about potential endpoints in order to achieve xss and more. Remember to always read the documentation from the tools.
