Day 52 comes with a new tool called [Subvenkon](https://github.com/CoffeeJunkiee/Subvenkon) and  a exercise of [hackthissite](https://hackthissite.org/) related to ```.htacces``` file and directory listing.

## Not liking Venkon Web interface? Use Subvenkon!
From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). I find [venkon](https://www.venkon.us/subdomain-lister/) very useful at the time to gather subdomains, but one of the problems that I had was **constantly copy pasting and having couple problems at the time to pipe the results**. That's why I created [Subvenkon](https://github.com/CoffeeJunkiee/Subvenkon) which does the same thing than [venkon](https://www.venkon.us/subdomain-lister/), but from the terminal and without duplicates or strange strings so it's easier to pipe it. 

To get Subvenkon click [here](https://github.com/CoffeeJunkiee/Subvenkon).

### Usage 

It's pretty straight forward. Just type:
```python subvenkon.py -d domain.com```

This is an example with an open scope program from Hackerone which is [AT&T](https://hackerone.com/att)

Once the subdomains have been gathered, **there will be a file named as the domain and with the results**
