Day 85 comes with some readings on Hacking companies through help desk and reNgine for recon. 

## Hacking companies through help desk

## Recon with reNgine

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). Trying different kind of recon frameworks including Offensive AI, I gave it a shot to [reNgine](https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine) and to be honest it is just amazing! Just love how great and personalized can be and also how useful can be if it is run from a VPS. Here is a video demo.
