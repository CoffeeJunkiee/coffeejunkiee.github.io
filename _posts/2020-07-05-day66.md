Day 66 comes with a nice sunday rest after couple reports during the week waiting to get resolved :). Also I'd like to share a source for OSINT. 

## Awesome OSINT

If you wanna get some accurate resources I strongly recommend [awesome OSINT](https://github.com/jaikishantulswani/awesome-osint). The reason why is because it is complete on source for different OSINT perspectives.
