## From Misconfigured S3 Bucket to Critical Vulnerability

While doing some recon and finding some S3 buckets that seemed that might be well configured. I never came across a great opportunity of finding a misconfigured S3 bucket. That's why this post from [Harsh Bothra](https://twitter.com/harshbothra_) seemed such a great example and learning source, therefore all credits to him. 

[Harsh Bothra](https://twitter.com/harshbothra_) while doing recon, he found an asset which was a bucket hosting static resources. The bucket was open, therefore the next action to proceed was to check the following permissions according [Harsh Bothra](https://twitter.com/harshbothra_). 

- Create something on the bucket
- Modify something on the bucket
- Delete something on the bucket
- Read some sensitive data on the bucket (case-by-case basis)

Therefore, in order to test this, AWS CLI can be helpful.

- In order to check if you have access to upload or create a file use the following command. 
```
aws s3 cp yourtestfile.txt s3://bucketname
```

- In order to check if you have access to delete a file use the following command 
```
aws s3 rm s3://bucketname/yourtestfile.txt
```
