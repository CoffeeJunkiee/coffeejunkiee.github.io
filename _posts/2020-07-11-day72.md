Unfortunately I have just been able to find one so far, but information comes everyday relating to this kind of vulnerabilities. Today [Abhishek  Karle](@AbhishekKarle3) brings us an interesting writeup related to the usage of IDN Homograph attack where he explains how he was able to do an account take over.
