## Privilege Escalation in free and paid plan

From [Rajesh Ranjan](https://twitter.com/eh_rajesh). Here is the link of the [article](https://medium.com/@odayalhalbe1/how-you-can-find-privilege-escalation-bug-when-you-have-free-and-paid-plan-8aefcbd897ad).

## Tired Of Captchas in Google Dorks?

Couple week ago while trying to obtain more information about a target, I was finding myself tired of clicking captchas from Google, then while reading "[How we Hijacked 26+ Subdomains](https://medium.com/@aishwaryakendle/how-we-hijacked-26-subdomains-9c05c94c7049)", the author mentions a blog post called "[Extract URLs from Googleâ€™s Web SERPs](https://www.chrisains.com/seo-tools/extract-urls-from-web-serps/)" which allows the user to extract the URl from page to page. 

### Example

- This is the site while incerting the dorks

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/100dl/day45/dork.png" alt="nmap scan">

- This is after using cerp to get URLs related to yahoo.com

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/100dl/day45/cerp.png" alt="nmap scan">

**Depending on your Dorks, it depends the results from cerp**
