## Gathering Bug Bounty Tips from Twitter!

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). While learning web app testing, twitter always seemed useful at the time to share knowledge an information related to penetration testing. This bought my attention when I saw [Gwendal's tool](http://bugbountytips.me/) which allows to search bug bounty tips with specific key words such as OAuth,XSS,XEE and such. Kudos to [Gwendal's tool](http://bugbountytips.me/) for the tool!

That's it for today, happy Thursday.
