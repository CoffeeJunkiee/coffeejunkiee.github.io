Welcome! So, before starting with couple ways of getting this box, I want to explain the goal of this and the following posts. After two attempts to pass my OSCP exam (which both attemps failed) I looked the need to practice and explain some of the learning obtained with different machines in Hack The Box, so I decided to make some challenging boxes before my third attempt to the OSCP exam. I chose this list from [NetSec Focus] (https://www.netsecfocus.com/) in order to improve my penetration testing skills. From this list Jeeves is the first box, so let's get to it.
