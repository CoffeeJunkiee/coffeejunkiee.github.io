Day 32 comes with a new month and goals from [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_), and [Rajesh Ranjan](https://twitter.com/eh_rajesh). One of the goals is to submit 3 vulnerabilities a week, to start that's the goals of the week, let's see how it goes. Besides that some Information Disclosure and RXSS and IDORs on cookies.

## Information Disclosure and RXSS

[Rajesh Ranjan](https://twitter.com/eh_rajesh). I check this writeup today, and I learnt that, how a researcher was able to find a RXSS. Checkout the writeup [here](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/information-disclosure-and-reflected-xss-on-tokopedia-1b3a00ec64c6).

## Eyes for IDORs

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). IDORs are pretty common in Web Applications, by experience, I cannot relate to this case scenario because I have not catch a IDOR bug, not yet :), but I'm willing to learn and look for it, therefore here it is one writeup that I really like it related to IDORs in a cookie!

### IDORs on cookies

So, the attacker saw the following cookie which contained a ```SESIONID``` parameter! The cookie looked something like this:
```
shoppingID=88ea39539e74fa67c09a4fc0bc8ebe6d00978392PEr9ySESSIONID3552522PXGLkC;
```

The attacker saw the great chance to change the 7 numbers that follows after ```SESIONID``` which gave him access to different kind of accounts. Therefore, this counts as improper authentication and IDOR on access token.
