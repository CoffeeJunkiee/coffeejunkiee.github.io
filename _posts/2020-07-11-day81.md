## From Host Header injection to SQL injection

From [Rajesh Ranjan](https://twitter.com/eh_rajesh). #day81 comes with a SQL injection from Host Header injection. Here is the link for the [article](https://medium.com/@daoud_youssef/from-host-header-injection-to-sql-injection-e7c61a61b575).

## Recon with Intrigue IO 

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). Checking out different recon frameworks, I got astonished on how useful [intrigue.io](https://intrigue.io/) can become. It has several modules to do recon, in this case I tried to do subdomain brute force. Besides that you can run it on docker!
