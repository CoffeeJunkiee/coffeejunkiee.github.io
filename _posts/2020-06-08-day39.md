Day 39 comes with Android vulnerabilities, a curious report about CRLF and Stored XSS, and a weekly report with bugs. 

## Finding common vulnerabilities in Android

## CRLF and Stored XSS 

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). Last week I spent a good amount of time studying and practicing different ways to achieve XSS due to one of my targets had a HTML Injection, but, I wanted to escalate it to XSS. Therefore, this time while reading things in "hacktivity" at hackerone I found this writeup of CRLF injection to Stored XSS. Furthermore, as an update of the goal of three reports per week. I didn't achieve it this time, but this was the bug that I found.

Now, let's get into the report found at Hackerone.

The attacker found a CRLF injection in the following url:
```
# Encoded URL
https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/x/%E5%98%8A%E5%98%8Dset-cookie%3A%20test%3Dtest%3B%20Domain%3D.twitter.com%3B%20Path%3D%2F%3B%20Expires%3DSat%2C%2015-Dec-2018%2009%3A45%3A55%20UTC
# Decoded URL
https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/x/嘊嘍set-cookie: test=test; Domain=.twitter.com; Path=/; Expires=Sat, 15-Dec-2018 09:45:55 UTC
```

As you can see in the decoded URL, the attacker was able to set a cookie due to HTTP Splitting by the CRLF injection.

Later on, the attacker found a great chance to upload a ```jpg``` picture with an XSS payload which by replacing the ```jpg``` extension by ```html``` xss will pop up. But how these two bugs can be chained? The attack can be chained by injecting the attacker ```auth_token``` cookie. In that way the the injected image will appear in the victim side causing the XSS to occur.
