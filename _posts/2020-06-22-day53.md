Day 53 comes with a pretty handy tool for recon called [httpx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx) and some of its basic usage. 

## Killing it with httpx

Coming from a network pentesting background, CIDR ranges are beautiful to me. Trying nmap to scan the ports (which takes quiet long time), and using masscan on my VPS, I needed something just to resolve the CIDR into urls wheter their using HTTPS or not. Fortunately, instead of going for the long path of scanning the while CIDR range with masscan, and using the script from nmap to check the title, I found [httpx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx) pretty useful this time. It's like httprobe, but high on steroids. Big thanks to the people from [projectdiscovery](https://twitter.com/pdiscoveryio).

### Usage

Having already your domain list? No problem, [httpx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx) got you covered. Wheter you need the **title, status code, and content lenght** httpx will make it fast and easier. Remember to read the user's guide from their github page.

#### For normal HTTP probe

```bash
cat domain-list.txt | httpx 
```

#### Wanna include title, status code, and content lenght?
```
cat domain-list.txt | httpx -title -content-length -status-code
```

#### My favorite, with CIDR ranges
```
echo "10.10.10.10/28" | httpx 
```
