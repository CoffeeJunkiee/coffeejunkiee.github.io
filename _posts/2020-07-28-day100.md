## To be done 

From [Sam (CoffeeJunkie)](https://twitter.com/coffeejunkiee_). #100daystohackandimprove showed the complexity and persistence need it in the field. After countless duplicates and couple payouts, still exciting to have the opportunity to apply an offensive security mindset during web app testing. The path for learning is long, and it's not recommend it to go alone. I'm pleased to say that #100daystohackandimprove was a pretty interesting experience.
